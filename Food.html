		<h2>Goulash <span>(Gulyás)</span></h2>
		<p>If you ever visit Hungary or go to a Hungarian restaurant, it will be impossible to avoid goulash. This is because goulash is one of the most popular Hungarian dishes around. Goulash is a hearty and warm stew filled with beef, paprika, onions, and potatoes. </p>

		<h2>Fisherman’s Soup (Halászlé)</h2>
		<p>The name “fisherman’s soup” may not sound the most appetizing, but when made the right way, this soup can be astoundingly delicious. It is a very popular dish, much like goulash. Traditionally, it is cooked over a fire in a kettle, although if you’re making this at home, you can settle for your stove.</p>

		<h2>Chicken Paprikash (Csirke Paprikás)</h2>
		<p>Chicken paprikash is the favorite dish of many, even non-Hungarians. As with the fisherman’s soup, chicken paprikash tends to be startlingly red and it is all because of the paprika. Besides the paprika, there are onions, tomatoes, garlic, and sweet peppers. To make the dish creamy, you will need to add sour cream.</p>

		<h2>Stuffed Cabbage Leaves <span>(Töltött Káposzta)</span></h2>
		<p>Stuffed cabbage leaves are common all across Eastern Europe, not just in Hungary. This dish is not all that different from the meat pancakes discussed earlier except that cabbage leaves are used instead of pancakes. For this reason, this meal can be a great idea if you’re trying to lose some weight.</p>

		<h2>Sour Cherry Soup (Meggyleves)</h2>
		<p>Sour cherry soup may sound strange if you’ve never heard about it before. Is it a dessert, or is it dinner? While this soup may seem like a dessert to non-Hungarians, you are actually meant to eat it before your main meal like any other soup. It includes sour cherries, sugar, and sour cream. The sour cream is usually served on top and the soup itself is cold.</p>
